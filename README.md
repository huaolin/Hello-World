My Part：task 3
The part I personally completed is task 3, 
which is mainly the calculation of the average degree of network nodes, 
the calculation of the average network path length and the average network clustering coefficient.

The test commands for task 3 are as follows:
python  assignment.py -network 10
python  assignment.py -test_network
